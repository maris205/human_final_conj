# **Humanity's Final Conjecture: Evaluation of AI Innovation Capability Based on Prime Number Distribution**

## **Abstract**

As Large Language Models (LLMs) saturate traditional benchmarks, existing evaluations fail to distinguish between knowledge reproduction and source innovation. This paper proposes the **"Innovation Turing Test,"** a paradigm designed to assess the divergent thinking and abductive reasoning essential for scientific discovery.

We construct an open-ended test case, the **"Prime-Chaos Conjecture,"** which requires models to bridge Peano arithmetic and symbolic dynamics. The task involves demonstrating that prime pseudorandomness manifests as low-dimensional deterministic chaos and deriving the Logistic map's topological properties at the band merging point ($u \\approx 1.5437$).

We detail a scalable human-AI collaborative evaluation method and present empirical results from models like Gemini and Qwen. Notably, Gemini successfully identified physical concepts such as the "Effective Horizon". This study aims to provide a quantitative yardstick for the transition of AGI from "Problem Solvers" to "Researchers".

## **Evaluation Methodology**

To reproduce the evaluation or test other models, follow these steps:

1. Upload the evaluation document **Humanity's Final Conjecture\_ Large Model Innovation Ability Evaluation.pdf** to the Large Language Model (LLM).  
2. Use the following prompt to initiate the inquiry:

Please review the uploaded evaluation report, understand and analyze its content, and then respond based on the recommendations provided in Section 5: "Extension Guidelines: Execution Pathways and Verification Protocols for Large Models."

*For specific evaluation criteria and scoring details, please refer to the main paper.*
